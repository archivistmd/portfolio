    <h1><span class="about">About Me</span></h1>

    <p>My name is Mesha, this is my <strong>Epicodus</strong> portfolio page.</p>
    
    <p> I have been dabbling in coding over the years for my art and for my hobbies. I found it to be something I not only enjoyed but that was something I looked forward to doing. After talking to some friends, developers and <strong>Epicodus</strong> alumni, I learned of Epicodus and thought it would be a good next step. To not only build a solid foundation in my knowledge and understanding of the different coding languages, but also get me started toward getting into a steady career that would work for both what I want and need from a job.</p><br>
